# Technology Stack for Scalable and Extensible Complaint Management System

## Context and Problem Statement

The Complaint Management System (CMS) must support large enterprise clients in sectors such as banking and telecommunications. These clients require a secure, scalable, and always-available system capable of handling thousands of simultaneous user complaints and integrating future enhancements such as chatbot automation and analytics.

The challenge is:

> How can we select a technology stack that ensures high scalability, maintainability, and seamless integration with future services (e.g. chatbot or analytics), while aligning with enterprise security and compliance standards?

## Considered Options

* **Java + Spring Boot + Angular + AWS:** Reliable and mature stack with strong scalability but heavier configuration and slower initial development.  
* **Node.js + Express + MongoDB + Docker:** Lightweight and flexible but less suitable for enterprise-grade authentication, maintainability, and long-term support.  
* **.NET Core + React + Azure (Chosen):** Modern, cloud-native stack with strong enterprise alignment, security, and support for modular microservices deployment.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **“.NET Core + React + Azure”**, because it provides a robust, enterprise-ready foundation that supports both immediate and future scalability needs of the CMS. The stack integrates seamlessly with Microsoft’s Azure ecosystem, allowing for cloud-native deployment, DevOps automation, and secure multi-tenant architecture.

This approach directly addresses the CMS’s extensibility and scalability goals:

* **Scalability and Performance:** ASP.NET Core APIs hosted on Azure App Services can scale automatically based on demand. Load balancing and containerization ensure consistent performance for thousands of concurrent users.
* **Extensibility:** React provides a modular front-end framework that simplifies the integration of new features such as chatbot widgets or analytics dashboards without disrupting the existing UI.
* **Enterprise Integration:** The stack integrates easily with Azure Active Directory, Key Vault, and other enterprise-grade identity and security tools.
* **Maintainability and Modularity:** The separation between .NET APIs and React front-end allows teams to work independently on different components, supporting continuous deployment and agile development.
* **Future-Proofing:** Azure’s ecosystem supports future enhancements such as Azure Cognitive Services (for chatbot NLP) and Application Insights (for monitoring and diagnostics).

### Consequences

#### Good

* **Highly scalable:** Azure App Services and Azure SQL Database support elastic scaling based on usage demand.  
* **Secure and compliant:** Built-in support for role-based access control, encryption, and enterprise authentication through Azure AD.  
* **Streamlined development:** Strong developer tooling (Visual Studio, Azure DevOps) accelerates the CI/CD pipeline.  
* **Extensible:** The modular API-first design simplifies adding features like chatbots, analytics, or third-party integrations.  
* **Cloud-native benefits:** Automatic deployment, monitoring, and rollback capabilities via Azure DevOps pipelines.

#### Bad

* **Higher cost:** Azure hosting and Microsoft licensing can increase operational expenses compared to open-source alternatives.  
* **Vendor lock-in:** Deep integration with Azure services may make migration to other cloud providers difficult.  
* **Learning curve:** Teams unfamiliar with .NET Core and Azure services may require training and onboarding time.  
* **Complexity in setup:** Multi-service deployment pipelines require proper DevOps configuration to avoid integration issues.
