# Security and Zero-Trust Communication (Secrets Vault and TLS)

## Context and Problem Statement

In a multi-tenant Microservices Architecture, the system must ensure the highest level of security for data both in transit and at rest, as required by financial and telecom compliance standards (validated by the System Administrator, Elena Petrova). Specifically, the Complaint Management System (CMS) faces two key challenges:

1. **Secrets Management:** Service-to-service communication and database connections rely on credentials. Hard-coding these credentials or using decentralized configuration files creates security risks, prevents automated key rotation, and makes auditing difficult.

2. **Secure Communication:** Data exchange between microservices, client applications, and APIs must be protected from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

How can we implement a security foundation based on Zero-Trust principles to manage secrets centrally, enforce defense-in-depth, and ensure all communication is secure and auditable?  

## Considered Options

* **Decentralized Secrets Management:** Store secrets (database passwords, API keys) in local configuration files or environment variables within each microservice.

* **Zero-Trust with Centralized Secrets Vault and TLS:** Implement a dedicated Secrets Vault for all sensitive credentials and enforce Transport Layer Security (TLS/HTTPS) for all network communication.

* **Service Mesh with Mutual TLS (mTLS):** Implement a service mesh (e.g., Istio) to automatically manage mTLS between all services, providing identity and encryption at the network layer.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: “Zero-Trust with Centralized Secrets Vault and TLS”, as it provides a strong, auditable security posture while minimizing the operational complexity of a full service mesh implementation.

This approach aligns with fundamental architectural security practices:

* **Secrets Vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault or Cloud Key Vault):** All database credentials, external API keys, and private service certificates will be stored in a centralized, dedicated Secrets Vault. This enables automated credential rotation (meeting the goal of the 'Rotate Database Credentials' story) and enforces the Principle of Least Privilege by allowing services to retrieve secrets only when necessary.

* **TLS/HTTPS Mandatory:** All external and internal service-to-service communication will be strictly enforced over HTTPS (TLS). This ensures that all data transmitted is encrypted (security-in-transit), establishing a secure channel between components.

* **Auditability:** Every interaction with the Secrets Vault and every attempt at data access (as detailed in the 'Verify Multi-Tenant Data Isolation' story) will be recorded in the Audit Log Service, ensuring full accountability and compliance.

## Consequences

### Good

* **Automated Key Rotation:** Enables the scheduled, safe rotation of database and API credentials, dramatically reducing the risk associated with compromised long-lived keys.

* **Compliance:** Meets regulatory requirements for encrypting data in transit and protecting credentials, supporting the System Administrator's (Elena's) compliance goals.

* **Defense-in-Depth:** Implements multiple layers of security (authentication at the API Gateway, authorization in the Domain Layer, and encryption at the transport layer).

* **Simplified Auditing:** A central log for all secret access and data queries simplifies security investigations and provides undeniable proof of access control enforcement.

### Bad

* **External Dependency:** The entire system is now dependent on the availability and performance of the Secrets Vault service. Robust failover and caching mechanisms are mandatory.

* **Certificate Management:** Requires disciplined management of TLS certificates (issuance, renewal, and revocation) for service endpoints.

* **Increased Latency:** TLS handshakes and encryption/decryption add a small, measurable overhead to all network communication, though this is a necessary trade-off for security.
