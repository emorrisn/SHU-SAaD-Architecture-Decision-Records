# Scalability and Multi-tenancy for the Complaint Management System

## Context and Problem Statement

The Complaint Management System (CMS) needs to handle thousands of simultaneous user complaints from large banking and telecom companies. The system must be available 24/7 and support a growing user base, with an expected 10% annual increase in users.

The challenge is:

> How can we architect the CMS to ensure high availability and scalability while managing distinct data and users for multiple large client organisations (multi-tenancy)?

## Considered Options

* **Monolithic Architecture:** A single, tightly-coupled application handling all concerns (UI, business logic, data).  
* **Three-Tiered Architecture:** Separates the application into presentation, business/application, and data tiers.  
* **Microservices Architecture:** Decomposes the application into a collection of independently deployable, loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific business capability.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **“Microservices Architecture”**, because it provides a highly scalable, resilient, and flexible foundation that aligns with the CMS’s need to support large-scale, multi-tenant deployments across multiple organisations.

This approach is most suitable for the Complaint Management System as it:

* **Maximises Scalability:** Each microservice (e.g. complaint logging, user management, reporting, notification) can be scaled independently based on usage patterns. This avoids over-provisioning and ensures consistent performance as the user base grows by 10% annually.
* **Enhances Fault Isolation and Resilience:** If one service fails (e.g. reporting), others (e.g. complaint submission) remain operational, maintaining overall system uptime and supporting the 24/7 availability requirement.
* **Simplifies Multi-Tenancy:** Each tenant can be mapped to isolated service instances or logical data partitions within each microservice. This improves security and simplifies customisation for large clients like banks and telecom providers.
* **Improves Deployment Flexibility:** Individual microservices can be updated, redeployed, or replaced without impacting the entire system, reducing downtime and deployment risk.
* **Supports Continuous Delivery and Evolution:** Teams can develop, test, and deploy microservices independently, allowing faster feature delivery and experimentation (e.g. introducing AI-based complaint categorisation or analytics services).

### Consequences

#### Good

* **High scalability:** Services can be scaled independently to meet demand without affecting the rest of the system.  
* **Fault tolerance:** Isolated service boundaries prevent a single point of failure.  
* **Faster development and deployment:** Independent pipelines enable continuous delivery for specific features.  
* **Multi-tenancy flexibility:** Easier to provide tenant-specific configurations, deployments, and data isolation.  
* **Future-proof design:** Easier integration with new technologies or third-party APIs.

#### Bad

* **Increased complexity:** Managing distributed services introduces challenges around deployment, monitoring, communication, and debugging.  
* **Operational overhead:** Requires robust DevOps practices, including container orchestration (e.g. Kubernetes) and centralized logging/monitoring.  
* **Data consistency:** Ensuring consistency across microservices may require eventual consistency patterns and careful design of inter-service communication.  
* **Higher infrastructure cost:** Running multiple services can increase hosting and management costs compared to a simpler three-tiered model.
